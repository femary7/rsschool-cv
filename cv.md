* I am open to any kind of new knowledge, I **really** like learning new things. My first profession (linguist, translator) taught me to absorb **multitudes of information** and to do it **very quickly**. For now I'm still looking for my purpose in life. Currently my ultimate goal is to get my second master's degree in cognitive science and implement my knowledge in the development of new technologies.
* **Native** Russian, English **C2**, Bulgarian **C2**, Markdown, CAT tools
* Currently I'm employed in _Yandex LLC_ as an **AI tutor**. My duty is to improve the abilities of _YandexGPT_ and _Yandex Search Engine_. I also have an extensive experience as a translator (e.g. [WAC syndrome](https://rarechromo.org/media/translations/Russian/WAC%20syndrome%20(DeSanto-Shinawi%20syndrome)%20Russian%20FTNW.pdf))
* Education: _Moscow State Linguistic University_ (Master's degree in **Linguistics. Technical Translation** and Bachelor's degree in **Linguistics. Translation Studies**)
